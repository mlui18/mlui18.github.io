# Hi everyone, I'm Michelle Lui

# What I'm up to right now

I'm currently a second year MPH student in Epidemiology at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics. My research interests lie in infectious disease and program implementation/evaluation in low-resource settings. I'm currently interning at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in the Bureau of Communicable Disease as a data analysis intern. After graduating Mailman, I am eventually planning to go to back to school to get my PhD in Epidemiology.
